## Description
With this project I was given starter code and I added functionality to it. The goal was to create a text editor that fulfilled the criteria of a PWA. I had some substantial struggles with deploying it as well as understanding every aspect. As i worked through the project I gained more fundamental knowledge on how to go about making a functional PWA.

## Usage
To utilize this project you can first find my application at this render link: https://tristans-text-editor.onrender.com/. It is currently not working due to unforseen issues, but in the future I hope to have a better understanding of Render and how to troubleshoot the errors it provides. Once working, you will be able to run the text application from the terminal and will be able to generate an HTML file, service worker, and a manifest file which will then allow the text editor to still function in the browser without any errors.
